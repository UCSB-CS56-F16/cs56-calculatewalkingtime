a)Description of Project:
The project is calculating the distance traveled from one place to another. It contains a map of the UCSB campus and calculates time from either walking or biking.

b)USER STORIES:
As the user, I can determine the amount of time it takes to walk from one building to another.

As the user, I can determine how long it would take to bike from one building to another.

c)Brief Assessment:
The software does run and it provides a map of the UCSB campus with checkboxes next to building to calculate the time it would take to get from one to the other. Three travel methods are given: Walking, biking, and by a 747.

d)POTENTIAL STORIES:
As the user, I could have more option of transportation, such as a skateboard or a scooter.

As the user, I would have different routes to choose from.

e)READ.ME:
It can replace walking and biking with methods of transformation. It can also update from UCSB to UCSB and IV.
Change the second sentence to "compile with ant compile and run the program with ant run".

f)Build.xml:
The build file seems to run fine but needs more descriptions on the targets.

g)Issues:
-Implementing Google Maps API
-Updating the campus map and to include IV
-Making all of the buildings clickable instead of checkboxes
-Improving the GUI

h)Additional Issues:
currently none

i)Code Assessment:
How the code is now, it is organized into two bigger methods containing smaller ones. They are main and go(). It seems to appear cluttered and messy, with a lot of spaces between the lines. The classes and their methods are clear, but only after reading through them more than once. The code is fairly easy to understand, but the organization makes it difficult to do so. I would tell them to focus on what each method does and how they relate to each other. Additionally, to look at the function go() first. 

j)Test Coverage:
There seems to be no test coverage for the program.
